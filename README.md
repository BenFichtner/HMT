# HMT
HMT is a Headless Managment Tool written in C++

HMM (Headless Managment Tool) is a basic system managment tool written initially for use on a Raspberry Pi running Ubuntu.

It is used to administer Network Attached Storage (NAS) shared using SAMBA.

The tool allows easy access to system information, quicky editing the system's SAMBA configuration, restarting SAMBA, and viewing current CPU Temperature.

Future versions of HMT will use the ncurses programming library to update the user interface.
